Grade: 30

## Description

The aim of the project is to develop an hardware component using VHDL that takes as input an image in grayscale and returns an image with an increased contrast according to the histogram equalization method.

### Implementation
The project includes:
- Description of the implementation (external and internal architecture of the component)
- Description of all the component states
- The experimental results
- Test-benches

### Tools
The tool used to synthesize the component design is XILINZ VIVADO WEBPACK with Target FPGA (xc7k70tfbv676-1).
